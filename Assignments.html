                    <h2>Week 2 HTML</h2>
                    <p>We'll start with week two because week one consisted of reading the syllabus and course expectations. I'll be honest, I was scared to take this class. My faith in my ability to learn this material so quickly was about a 2 out of 10. Week 2, we dove right in to HTML and our whirlwind adventure was underway.<br>HTML was pretty straightforward for me. The codecamp exercises were pretty easy and I started feeling like maybe this is how the rest of the course would be, relatively easy.<br>In this first assignment, we were asked to build three pages called nested, attributes, and tags to show how to perform each of those functions with a variety of elements in HTML.<br>The part of the assignment that was the most challenging was creating a nav bar. I ended up looking at the html used on another web page to figure out how to create my first ever navigation from scratch.</p>

                    <h2>Week 3 CSS</h2>
                    <p>A week went by and we were on to the next thing! Week three we wrote our CSS files and learned how to reference them within our html pages. I focused on the assignment requirements and aimed to change 10 style selectors within my referenced CSS. I did this assignment mostly on <a href="tobuy.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and also changed some of the styles on one of my previously built <a href="attributes.html" target="_blank">Attributes page</a>.<br>My struggles during this assignment were all related to the page layout. I couldn't figure out how to make columns for my lists! Good thing bootstrap cam along because I was feeling pretty defeated with my bland styling examples.</p>

                        <p>Silly me, I thought JavaScript would be easy! I write it into my PDF forms with Adobe, I hide and show fields based on selections, I edit text, I've done this before! This will be a snap!<br>Boy, was I wrong. I will say that the JavaScript assignment is the one I struggled with the most. I still haven't got it to work the way I wanted! I felt like I was banging my head on the desk for the whole week with nothing to show for it. Once again, I struggled with layout, but this time I also struggled with my script working locally but not on GitHub. Dr. Dan, our professor, give me some pointers on my assignment that I may have missed a label somewhere, but I never found it.<br>Now, I'm a pretty emotional person. When I turned my assignment in, I felt completely hopelessly lost. I was wondering how in the world I was going to understand Bootstrap when I couldn't even get these JavaScript functions to work? <br>Fast forward to today, and I'm feeling pretty good about the progress I made since this, "low point" and I'm so glad I didn't give up.</p>

                            <p>After the JavaScript debacle, I needed to catch my breath. Week 5 was perfectly timed. We watched videos and read articles on bootstrap, but no actual bootstrap development was expected. This week we started work on our final project pages. I went back to my html and CSS roots and ended up with a page I enjoyed for my final landing page. I also created what would eventually be my Team and About me pages. <br>I was still fearing Bootstrap, even after the assigned readings and videos, but I felt rested and ready to take it on.</p>

                                <p>To say I caught on quickly would be an understatement in my opinion. Who are these guys who worked for Twitter and as a side project developed this wonderful new way to develop for the web!? I could kiss them, I really could.<br>While developing the bootstrap page, I relied mostly on W3 Schools and the Getting Started with Bootstrap site posted to our reading assignments for that week. These sites had information on all the requested elements.<br>Now that I have built a few pages using Bootstrap, I'm never going back. What a perfectly wonderful, helpful development tool.</p>

                                <p>When I said I wanted to kiss those Bootstrap fellas, I meant it. The one thing I struggled with the most throughout the course was my page layouts. Bootstrap makes it so much easier to understand how to lay out your page. I defiantly want to revisit portions of this course so I can feel more confident in the different languages we've used. However, if I compare my knowledge in web development now to that of seven weeks ago, I have achieved a great deal. It feels really good to have tackled something so initially overwhelming to me. I will never regret the time I spent, even the frustrations I faced along the way because this moment feels SO good.<br>Now maybe I can take that vacation I need so badly, or at least a staycation. All while feeling completely confident and at ease in my achievements during this nutty time.</p>
